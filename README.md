**Credit Card Fraud Detection:**
A machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent transactions using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset.

 **Project Overview:**
This project applies data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and threshold tuning to build a fraud detection system that effectively identifies rare fraudulent transactions within a heavily imbalanced dataset.

 **Key Features:**
Handled class imbalance (fraud cases ~0.17%)

Built baseline and advanced models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Evaluated performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC

Applied probability threshold tuning to improve fraud recall

Provided detailed performance analysis and visualizations

 **Models Used:**
Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Threshold Tuning (Probability â‰¥ 0.3)

**Final Results:**
Accuracy: ~100%

Fraud Class Recall: ~74%

Fraud Class Precision: ~95%

ROC AUC Score: ~0.93

**Libraries Used:**
pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn


**Dataset:**
Source: Kaggle

Size: 284,807 transactions

Fraud Cases: 492 (~0.17%)

Note: Features are PCA-transformed for confidentiality

**What I Learned:**
Tackling extreme class imbalance in real-world datasets

Interpreting precision-recall tradeoffs in fraud detection

Threshold tuning as a strategy for imbalanced classification

Building reproducible and explainable ML workflows
